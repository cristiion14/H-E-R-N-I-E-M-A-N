Let's Play War is a game that me and a team of 5 people made it for an unit called "Technical Game Development". It is a 3D multiplayer fps with power-ups made in Unity. 
The main Idea of the game was inspired from our childhood games where we were divided in two teams and we pretended to be in war.
The player can host or join a game room with up to 6 players. 
There are three characters available to play: 
The Bully, is the fat kid that has a go on everyone.
The Kid, is that little kid that is always screaming and very hyperactive.
The Girl, is the independent woman that can take care of herself.
My contribution to this game was the networking system, the player movements, the shooting mechanics and the programming of the animations.
