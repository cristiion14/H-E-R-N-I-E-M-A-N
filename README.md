Flippy Knife is the project that I am currently working on in Unity, it is a replica of the mobile game "Flippy Knife".
So far, I managed to create the mechanics of the game such as: the rotation of the knife, the way that it landes on the wooden blocks,  a camera follower and some debugging for the landing.
